# IES-Internship
To Explore and try to Visualize the GBXML 3D data in Unity 3D Engine.
I have also attached my certificate of the Internship.

### Tasks Performed

1. Basis of IESVE – My first assigned task was to
  explore the IESVE software basics and find out
  the methods of visualizing the GBXML data in
  Unity.


2. Visualize Sample Data in Unity using Scripting
  - Researching what format of Data would be
  best suitable for visualizing in Unity.
    Created:
    a) 3D Scatter Plot
    b) Simple Objects (Meshes)

3. Data Formats Explored – XML,JSON, CSV.
  CSV format is not suitable for large scale
  structures. The best scalable option and also
  supported by Unity is JSON.

4. Other Methods to Visualize- Apart from Unity the other
  software I discovered for visualization with Python , JSON was :
  Blender
